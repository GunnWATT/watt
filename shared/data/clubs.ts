AHA Club meetings and activities will combine service and well-being with scientific learning. Members of our club will explore the basics of cardiovascular health and research, including heart anatomy and physiology, common risks, and how lifestyle choices such as nutrition, physical activity, sleep, and stress affect heart health. This background knowledge helps club members understand heart health topics before sharing them with others.  Our club will put this knowledge into action through service-based activities focused on heart health and school safety. One of our main goals is to organize a CPR awareness and certification event with certified instructors, where students can learn hands-only CPR and what to do in real-life emergencies. The goal of this event is to help students feel prepared, not overwhelmed, and to show that basic CPR skills are something anyone can learn. Through initiatives like this, members will build leadership and teamwork skills while making a meaningful impact on the well-being of our school community.",

We plan to also step away from the school campus to light up the lives of shelter animals by visiting shelters and running with the dogs, or volunteering together. Another idea is to bring the whole school together on this goal, by creating an area for students to drop off any pre-loved pet toys, food, and blankets to bring to shelters who are in need of supplies.",
