A MESSAGE FROM 
THE PRINCIPAL 
Dear Gunn Student, 
Our vision is to support all Gunn students as they prepare themselves to thrive as global citizens in a rapidly changing 
world. We develop our students’ knowledge, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills, and nurture their curiosity, 
creativity, and resilience, empowering every child to reach his or her fullest intellectual, social, and creative potential. 
Toward  that  end,  our  school  offers  a  rich  and  expansive  academic  program  that  requires  you  to  plan  and  make 
decisions based on personal strengths, goals and interests. 
The Course Catalog is compiled to help you and your parents with the decision-making process.  Here are a few points 
that we encourage you to consider during the course selection process: 
• Be open. Don’t shy away from taking a class that is outside of your typical academic interest or that you think 
you should – you might discover something you love. 
• Talk to people (your counselor, teachers, parents, and others who know you well), ask lots of questions 
and
 
remember that what you want to study is ultimately your choice. 
• Take time to reflect on who you are and who you are trying to become; select classes that will help you develop 
new ways of thinking and understanding. 
Before making choices read through this book and familiarize yourself with all of the opportunities available. Make 
yourself aware of the requirements of the various courses in order to determine how much time and effort you will 
need  to  satisfy  these  expectations.  Again,  most  importantly,  don’t  be  afraid  to  ask  questions  and/or  ask  for  help 
throughout this process. We are here for you. 
If you are considering taking multiple honors and/or Advanced Placement courses, we expect you to be thoughtful 
when  you  fill  out  the  Time  Management  form, and  we  hope  you  recognize  that  sleep  is  a  non-negotiable  of  nine 
hours/night. Not six hours per night... nine hours each night! Because we value your wellness, we encourage you to 
take no more than two AP courses per year. Taking on more often results in less sleep and the research is clear – your 
brain needs to recharge every night while you sleep. Please take good care of yourself in this regard. 
Finally, please know we want you to choose a healthy, balanced life. We encourage you to design a program of study 
that is personally challenging, requires you to stretch and grow and brings you joy. Choose courses that will allow you 
to  balance  your  academic  priorities  with  the  rest  of  your  in  and  out  of  school  responsibilities.  We  hope  you  select 
courses that will leave you with enough time to develop the necessary skills to become resilient, ethical, and motivated 
learners and that honors your individual interests, strengths and talents. Most importantly, we want you to enjoy your 
high school years, learn to love learning and have fun!  This is a great time to be a Titan!

4. Ability to integrate knowledge among disciplines 
5. Reading with understanding 
6. Critical and creative thinking to solve problems 
7. Effective use of technology 
SLOs   
The SLOs addressed by each course are indicated for each department.  Most departments indicate the SLOs addressed 
following each course description.  The numbers correspond with the numbers indicated above. 
Homework Expectations 
To assist students in making appropriate choices for the coming school year, the hours of work expected of students 
outside of class time is indicated below each course description or, in some cases, at the start of course descriptions for 
each department.  

 
MISSION STATEMENT  
& GOALS 
 
 
It’s a Great Day to be a Titan! 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
MISSION STATEMENT 
The Mission of Henry M. Gunn High School is to foster a community of creative thinkers who will acquire knowledge, 
skills,  values  and  integrity  to:  be  resilient,  responsible,  respectful,  contributing  citizens;  lead  rewarding  lives  which 
pursue personal excellence and lifelong learning. 
 
 
SCHOOL IMPROVEMENT  
GOALS 
GOAL #1:
 Develop a culture that broadly defines and promotes multiple paths to success, embraces self-discovery 
and   social-emotional   well-being   and   values   the   love   of   learning   beyond   traditional   metrics   of 
achievement. 
GOAL #2:
 Increase achievement for all learners at Gunn High School, especially our African American, Hispanic, 
Socio-Economically disadvantaged, English Language Learners and Special Education students. 
GOAL #3:
 Create a comprehensive data system and align course curriculum to regularly assess student progress, 
inform instruction and aid communication at the classroom, department and school levels. 
 
  

 
COURSE SELECTION 
A common goal from the PAUSD School Board and the Gunn High School WASC School Improvement plan is “to 
raise  the  achievement  of  historically  underrepresented  (HUR)  students  and  increase  participation  and  success  in 
rigorous courses at the secondary level, we will assure equity of preparation, access, opportunity, and support from 
Pre-K to 12
th
 grade.” We are committed to using course enrollment practices that increase access to honors and AP 
courses for historically underrepresented students. All students will have the right to participate in our honors and 
Advanced Placement Program, as long as prerequisite coursework is successfully completed. 
Our definition of successful completion of a course is aligned with the University of California System definition that 
a student must earn a C- or higher to demonstrate minimal proficiency. 
The school master schedule is built in the spring based upon student needs and student course requests. The schedule 
is constructed so that students are enrolled in courses they must have, and every effort is made to schedule the electives 
they would like to have. The schedule also takes into account the staff and facility parameters that affect the schedule. 
Courses  and  schools  are  staffed  based  on  student  course  selection  in  the  spring.  Once  course  sections  are  finalized, 
changes will be made only within extenuating circumstances based on approval from the Assistant Principal of Student 
Services. Therefore, every student should regard the schedule they receive as a contract. The school has provided the 
courses, and the student has the obligation to attend and participate in those courses. 
All students must be enrolled in a minimum of five (5) courses to be considered full-time students. Students will not 
be permitted to drop a course if this puts them below the minimum required course/credit load.  
Student Grade Level Recommended Number of Courses per Semester 
9
th
 grade 7 courses 
10
th
 grade Minimum of 6 courses 
11
th
 grade Minimum of 5 courses 
12
th
 grade Minimum of 5 courses 
        NOTE:  These course minimums may be adjusted for students with IEPs, 504s or RtI Plans. 
 
Student Responsibilities in the Scheduling Process 
1. Discuss selections with the academic teachers and inquire about the elective programs from the teachers in 
those subject areas. 
2. Read and discuss the Course Catalog with your parents. 
3. Consult with your counselor and Instructional Lead when questions arise. 
4. Discuss the preliminary course selections with your parents. 
5. Fill out the Time Management Worksheet and make adjustments to your selections, as needed, to maintain 
a balanced life. 
6. Go to the Infinite Campus Portal and complete online course selection. You must select 
at least one
 
alternate 
course for all electives.
  If no alternate courses are chosen and another course selection needs to be made, 
you will be placed in a course with low enrollment. 
• 
The portal is open for registration:  February 2, 2022 
• 
The portal will close on:  February 28, 2022 
 

School’s Responsibility in Scheduling 
1. The school shall build a master schedule to support student selection and learning to the best of our ability. 
 
2. The school shall provide appropriate support in the course selection process. 
a. Incoming 9
th
 grade students will have course selection presentations along with the development 
of their Four-Year-Plan at their respective middle school, a parent informational night, parent 
meetings for questions and follow-up brief student meetings at the middle school to confirm 
schedule selections. 
b. Rising grade 10 students will have a group session with their counselor in the month of January 
through the SELF program. During this meeting, their Four-Year-Plan will be reviewed and 
adjusted. 
c. Rising grade 11 students will have group conferences regarding course selection and four-year 
planning. 
d. Rising grade 12 students will have course selection and four-year planning support during PRIME 
sessions in January. 
 
3. The school shall review and provide a course catalog to all students electronically to support their decision 
making in course selection. Paper copies of the catalog may be available on request. 
 
4. Once the course registration window closes on February 28
th
, 
a course selection verification document, 
Honors/AP Contract and Time Management Worksheet will be available through Schoology. Students 
must complete and submit the appropriate forms through their Counseling course in Schoology. 
 
Dual Enrollment Courses 
Dual Enrollment courses refer to high-school courses that have gone through curricular alignment with a community 
college  and  whose  students  are  enrolled  in  two  institutions  concurrently,  therefore  earning  high  school  credits  and 
college credits simultaneously. 
Students  in  dual  enrollment  courses  will  receive  regular  credit  per  course.  For  example,  if  a  “regular”  high  school 
course earns five credits, the dual enrollment version of that course will earn five credits on the PAUSD transcript.  
Grades,  upon  completion  of  the  course,  will  be  weighted  similarly  to  AP  or  Honors  classes  in  weighted  GPA 
calculations, as they are rigorous courses that have gone through an alignment process with the community college. 
Off-Campus Courses (non-PAUSD)  
Courses required for graduation must be taken on campus. 
However, some courses, usually for elective credit or to 
make up a D or an F earned in a previous course, may be taken off campus 
with prior approval
. Transcript credit will 
be  granted  only  for  approved  courses  taken  at  an  accredited  school.  Prior  approval  forms  are  available  in  the 
Counseling Office or online in the Counseling section of the Gunn website. For any course taken off campus, it is the 
responsibility of the student to ensure that the course is taken through an accredited institution and that the course 
will be accepted by colleges. 
All courses taken off-campus require the prior approval 
of the student’s parent/guardian, the student’s counselor, 
and Assistant Principal of Student Services. 
Students wishing to take community college courses must first obtain the written permission of the Assistant Principal 
of  Student  Services  through  the  Off-Campus  Course  Approval  form  available  on  the  Counseling  page  of  the  Gunn 
website.
 Please be aware that community colleges will not allow students to take a course that is also offered at 
the high school.
 Also, courses taken at the community college are college-level courses and the start of a permanent 
college transcript that must be included when applying to other colleges. 
No more than 40 credits of the 220 credits 
required for graduation from PAUSD 
may be taken at off-campus institutions. Only 80 credits per year can be placed 
on a student’s transcript. Summer School credits will be applied to the following school year. 
College level courses are given double credit but are not weighted except for Dual Enrollment classes offered on sight 
(see Dual Enrollment information p.88) 
 
 

Prioritize Graduation Requirements 
Palo Alto Unified School District graduation requirements (including CTE and VPA) must be satisfied before students 
are allowed to take two classes in the same discipline (e.g., two World Languages classes at the same time or two Science 
classes at the same time). Any exception to this policy must be approved by the counselor and by the Assistant Principal 
of Student Services.   
Prior Recommended Course(s) 
Prior recommended courses 
are 
STRONGLY suggested courses
. Students who have completed prior 
recommended courses have the necessary foundational skills to be successful in a course. Students should consult 
with the teachers of the course of interest before attempting to take a course without having completed the prior 
recommended courses. 
Schedule Modifications 
Gunn High School does not grant schedule changes unless the request meets one or more of the criteria listed below. 
Any  student  wishing  to  request  a  schedule  modification  must  do  so  by  completing  the  Schedule  Correction  Form 
available in the Counseling Office. The form must be completed and returned by the dates indicated in the Calendar 
of Events posted on the Gunn website. Forms will be reviewed by the school counselors and administration. 
The criteria for a schedule change are as follows:   
• Graduation requirement missing from schedule (12
th
 only)    
• Course already taken (10
th
-12
th
) 
• Prior courses – does not meet recommended prior course(s) (9
th
-12
th
) 
• Schedule has an error (same class listed twice, class omitted, or class requested not included) (9
th
-12
th
) 
• Schedule has a class which has been taken over the summer and needs to be dropped in the fall (9
th
-12
th
) 
• Any course that a student wishes to add to their schedule must be included as an “alternate” on their course 
selection list. 
NOTE:
  
We cannot accommodate schedule requests or changes based on
 
teacher preference, specific class period 
requests, or  learning  style. We  strongly believe  that  students  benefit  from  learning  from  a  variety  of  different 
teachers. 
 
Lane Changes 
Lane changes must be initiated by a conversation with the student’s current teacher. The student’s Counselor 
will be notified once the student submits the GUNN SCHEDULE CORRECTION REQUEST FORM, which can 
be found on the Gunn Counseling webpage. Counselors will work with the departmental Instructional Lead to 
finalize the request. 
 
English  Department  Course  Level  Change  Policy:
 The  English  department  is  dedicated  to  providing  the  best 
learning environment for all students. Courses with the same name do not necessarily cover the same standards and 
texts simultaneously. Therefore, all English course level changes must take place by the end of the second week of the 
semester.  Such  changes  are  contingent  on  the  Instructional  Lead’s  approval.  The  Instructional  Lead  will  consider  a 
student’s current and past performance, class size, dynamic of the class, and the overall circumstances. Our semester-
long course system does allow students to initiate level changes before the start of the next semester, depending on 
space available in the class they want to move into. 
Social Studies Department Course Level Change Policy: 
With the exception AP Us History, level changes must take 
place  by  the  end  of  the  second  week  of  the semester/year.    Students  who  wish  to  drop  AP  Econ  or  AP  Psychology 
during the first semester must do so by the end of the second week of the semester in order to be placed in Econ 11 or 
a non-AP Social Studies elective during the first semester. Anyone dropping after that date will be placed in Econ 11 
or a non-AP Social Studies elective at the start of second semester. Students wishing to move from AP US History to 
US History must do so within the first 4 weeks of first semester. 
Math Department Course Level Change Policy:
 Students choose a particular lane based on their performance in the 
previous course, teacher recommendation, and potential summer work. Students earning a C- or below in a class can 
request  a  lane  change  during  the  year.  Such  changes  are  contingent  on  class  size  and  must  be  approved  by  the 
Instructional Lead of the department. Changes can only be made before the end of the 1
st
 quarter or at the semester 
break.  Students  who  change  lanes  during  the  semester  will  carry  over  their  current  homework  grade  to  their  new 

course, but not their grade on assessments. A plan for reassessing on missed learning targets will be arranged between 
teacher and student. 
Science  Department  Course  Level  Change  Policy:
 If  students  show  signs  of  struggling  before  the  end  of  the  first 
progress reporting period, it may be possible for them to change levels of a course, but only if there is room in the 
alternate course and only if a major schedule change is not required. Level changes must be approved by both teachers 
as well as the Instructional Lead. All efforts will be made to support struggling students and to facilitate success (“C-” 
or higher) in their science courses. 
Students wishing to challenge themselves in a higher level of a course may do so at the start of the school year, if there 
is room; however, once they have changed, they will need to stay in that course until the end of the semester. Teachers 
recommend that students stay in a course for the first full unit of study in order to have multiple types of assessments 
(quiz, test, lab report, homework) to help inform their desire to change levels. 
Students interested in changing levels should contact their science teachers as soon as possible in order to discuss their 
options. Students who change levels during the semester will carry over their current grade to their new course. 
English language learners are correctly placed in a class if they demonstrate enough knowledge of English to earn a 
“C-” grade or better. At any time, if they are not able to perform at that level due to their English language proficiency, 
the  counselor  together  with  the  EL  coordinator  will  support  the  student’s  lane  change,  or  dropping  of  the  course. 
(California State Board of Education Policy #98-04) (California State Board of Education Policy #98-04) 
Dropping a Course 
Students wishing to drop courses in which they are enrolled must submit a Schedule Correction Request Form to their 
counselor. Schedule Correction Request Forms can be found on the Gunn website. Students must attend the class until 
their schedule is officially changed. 
Colleges should be notified of any changes in academic schedule if completed after the application has been sent. It is 
the student’s responsibility to make this notification. 
A student wishing to drop a course in which they are enrolled and not have it appear on their transcript must do so 
by the date indicated on the Calendar of Events posted on the Gunn website. 
Grading 
A student wishing to drop a course in which they are enrolled and not have it appear on their transcript must do so 
by the date indicated on the Calendar of Events posted on the Gunn website. Overall evaluation in a course is measured 
in  a  number  of  ways:  class  participation,  homework,  written  work,  performance  assessments  and  subjective  and 
objective testing at intervals during the course. Course grades are an average of quarter and exam grades. The following 
definitions appear on report cards and transcripts: 
A – Superior 
B – Good 
C – Satisfactory 
D – Poor 
F – Unsatisfactory 
I – Incomplete 
P – Pass-Credit 
NM – No Mark 
The Use of Plus or Minus as Part of the Letter Mark 
The  mark  of  record  may  carry  a  plus  (+)  or  minus  (-)  attached  to  the  letter  grade  of  A,  B,  C,  or  D. The  pluses  and 
minuses will appear on both the report cards and transcripts. The Grade Point Average does not include the pluses or 
minuses in the calculation. 
Conditions Controlling Use of “I”, “P”, and “NM” 
• Mark of “I”: A mark of “I” (INCOMPLETE) may be given when for some unusual reason (illness) a student has 
been unable to complete required course work. The student must enter a contract with the teacher to complete 
the work. If the contract has not been fulfilled and the “I” has not been changed to a different mark by the end of 
the next grading period in which the student received an incomplete, the “I” will be converted to a mark of “F” 
by the Registrar. A mark of “I” may not be given as a final mark at the close of the school year. 

• Mark of “P” (PASS-CREDIT): A mark of “P” may be given only for non a-g courses or in special circumstances. 
A mark of “P” is not used for calculation of the GPA. 
• Mark of “NM” (NO MARK): A mark of “NM” may be given when it is inappropriate to make an evaluation. 
Credit will not be given and “NM” will not impact GPA. 
Eligibility for a Mark 
A new student who enrolls in a given course at least four weeks prior to the close of a grade-reporting period (semester) 
is entitled to a mark (including NM). A student who has withdrawn from the district, school or course during the four 
weeks prior to the end of a grade reporting period is entitled to a valid mark (including NM) even though the student 
is no longer enrolled.  
Maximum Graduation Credits Earnable 
A student may not earn more than a maximum of 80 credits toward graduation in any given school year. This includes 
summer school and any courses taken off campus. Courses taken off campus during the summer are applied towards 
the following school year (please see above guidance for courses taken off-campus). 
Repeated Course 
When  an  academic  course  is  repeated  because  a  student  intends  to  improve  the  mark  of  record,  the  credit  shall  be 
attached to the better mark; both marks shall remain on the transcript. The higher mark is used in the computation of 
the GPA. Students are not allowed to repeat a course in which they earned a C- or above. Repeated courses are applied 
to the school year in which the course was originally attempted.

CONTRACT 
HENRY M. GUNN HIGH SCHOOL 
ADVANCED PLACEMENT CLASSES CONTRACT 
	 
Gunn  High  School  supports  any  student  who  wishes  to  enroll  in  Advanced  Placement  (AP)  classes. However,  the 
majority  of  AP  classes  are  reserved  for  11&12th  graders.  Honors  and  AP  classes  are  NOT  weighted  for  9
th
 grade 
students.  AP  Computer  Science  Principles  is  the  only  approved  AP  class  for  9
th
 graders. Please remember  that 
Advanced  Placement  courses  are  college  level  courses.  Students  should  be  motivated  to  take  an  AP  class  by  an 
appreciation for the subject.  Students who are overextended with academics and/or extracurricular activities should 
give careful consideration to whether they have time to devote to an AP class and also to the number of AP classes that 
they can successfully complete. Gunn High School suggests a maximum of two AP classes per semester. 
Students who enroll in an AP course are expected to:
 
1. Be independent learners willing to read, learn, ask questions, pursue outside reading and research, integrate 
and discuss material from diverse sources. 
2. Meet any prerequisites prior to enrolling in an AP course. 
3. Prepare for and take tests on time. 
4. Accept that enrollment in an AP course does not guarantee an A or B grade. 
5. Spend more than the average amount of time on work outside of class. 
Students who enroll in an AP courses and their parent/guardian must sign the following written contract:
 
1. I  recognize  that  I  have  to  demonstrate  independence  and  responsibility.    AP  courses  typically  require  more 
homework compared to non-AP college prep courses (approximately 40 minutes a night or 2.5 hours a week). 
2. I commit to remain enrolled in the AP courses I have chosen for the entire year (or semester for AP Econ). If 
special circumstances arise and I must drop an AP course, I understand there may not be space available in a 
college prep class.  I understand I may have to delay taking a required class because of my drop. 
3. I understand that Gunn High School does not recommend students take more than two AP classes per year. 
4. I  understand  there  may  be  a  prerequisite  for  an  AP/Honors  course  as  outlined  in  the  Paly/Gunn  course 
catalog.  By enrolling in an AP/Honors course, I certify that I meet these prerequisites. 
5. I agree to uphold Gunn High School’s Academic Integrity Policy.  
6. I will speak with my parent/guardian, teacher or guidance counselor if I start feeling overwhelmed with my 
academic workload. 
7. I  realize  that  by  enrolling  in  an  Advanced  Placement  course  I  am  expected  to  take  the  corresponding 
Advanced  Placement  Examination  in  May.    Funding  support  for  this  examination  may  be  available  for 
students with demonstrated financial need. 
8. I will complete the Time Management Worksheet to the best of my ability and use this tool in selecting my 
courses to maintain a balanced life.

>> ENGLISH  
The  English program  at  Gunn  High  School  focuses  on  the  traditional  concerns  of  the  discipline—literature, 
composition, language, and grammar. Literature serves as a resource for the study of ideas, culture, and values, as well 
as the development of composition skills. The study of composition and writing emphasizes the art and the craft, the 
organization and the support, and the clear and effective use of language in its written forms. Vocabulary, language, 
and grammar studies are integrated with the study of literature and composition. 
The  Gunn  English  program  consists  of  a  four-year  required  sequence  of  both  required  and  elective  semester-long 
courses  designed  to  meet  students’  needs  in  literature,  composition,  and  language  study.  The  complete  sequence 
includes required courses in American, World, Contemporary, and Western Literatures, as well as in communication 
skills and literary genres. 
In 2022-2023, students in grades 9 and 10 should enroll for the two courses required of freshmen and sophomores. 
They should indicate on their Course Request forms a choice of (a) one semester of Contemporary Writers (College 
Preparatory) or Contemporary Heritage (accelerated) AND one semester of Writer’s Voice (College Preparatory) or 
Literary Style (accelerated). The other two required courses for grades nine and ten will be offered the following year. 
The choice of college prep or accelerated/advanced should be made with consideration of prior performance in English 
classes,  work  habits,  development  of  skills,  and  academic  interests.  Consultation  with  a  student’s  current  English 
teacher and counselor may be helpful in making a choice.

In 2022-2023, students in grades 11 and 12 will select one required semester of either American Literature (College 
Prep) or American Classics H, a course that carries an “honors” designation on the transcript. In addition, students in 
grades 11  and  12  should  indicate  on  their  Course  Request  forms  a  choice  of  one  semester-long  elective  and  two 
alternate elective selections. It is very important to make accurate and thoughtful selections on this form so that the 
department  schedule  accurately  reflects  students’  choices;  requests  made  later  are  often  difficult  or  impossible  to 
satisfy, and courses with insufficient initial enrollment, may not be offered through the department. Students in grade 
12 may also choose to take the yearlong AP English Literature & Composition course instead of two semester long 
English courses.  

SLOs & HOMEWORK EXPECTATIONS  
FOR ENGLISH COURSES 
The four-year sequence of English courses provides students opportunities to demonstrate competence in all areas of 
the Schoolwide Learner Outcomes (SLOs). Each course places particular emphasis on the following three SLOs: (2) 
effective communication through listening, speaking, and writing; (5) reading with understanding; and (6) critical and 
creative thinking to solve problems. 
By the nature of the discipline, the study of English will take some learners longer than others. In addition, due to the 
cycles of long- and short-term projects, a statement of the amount of time required for homework is only an estimation 
and an average. Homework for English generally comprises reading, writing, and the study of vocabulary. Advanced 
and honors courses, including AP English Literature and Composition, may require an average of three to five hours 
per week of work outside of class; regular and elective courses usually require less time. Included in many descriptions 
is the average time spent as surveyed by last year’s classes.

>> ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS (ELL) 
The English Language Learners (ELL) program offers individual and group instruction to meet the needs of students 
whose primary language is not English and have limited English proficiency. We prepare students for College Prep 
classes  by  providing  an  extensive  program  of  English  instruction  on  different  levels  (emerging,  expanding,  and 
bridging  English  language  proficiency).  For  the  students  with  emerging  English  proficiency, we  offer  individual 
tutoring in a student’s primary language to ensure access to the core curriculum. 
In addition, we offer ELL Social Studies courses which are taught by teachers in the Social Studies Department and are 
open to ELL students. The University of California grants admission credit “a” for all of the ELL social studies courses 
and credit “b” for one year of ELL (English EL28) and one year of Intermediate Composition. 
Because  our English  Learner students  contribute  a  welcoming diversity  to  our  campus,  we  encourage  them  to 
participate in school activities and clubs, so they can experience the social life of an American high school. This not 
only promotes cross-cultural understanding, but also helps young people maintain a positive self-concept. 
If English Learner students are at the emerging or expanding levels in English proficiency (that is, if they do not speak, 
read, and write in fluent English), and if they plan to earn a diploma of graduation, we urge them to enroll in the ELL 
program at Gunn High School.

>> MATHEMATICS   
Mathematics is offered in three college preparatory sequences. Students who are new to PAUSD are recommended 
for a math course based on the results of a placement test.    
Our  college  prep  pathway  is  a  four-year  sequence  that  prepares  students  for  their  first  calculus  course  in  college.  It 
begins with Algebra 1 and also includes Geometry, Algebra2 and Pre-Calculus. It is possible, by doing summer work, 
to begin in this pathway and still finish with AB Calculus. Please contact the math IL to discuss such a pathway. Our 
new Introduction to Data Science course will offer an alternative to Pre-Calculus. 
Students who have completed Algebra in middle school should enroll in the advanced or honors pathways. 
The  advanced  pathway  takes  students  through  Advanced  Placement  AB  Calculus,  and  prepares  them  to  finish  “C 
Calculus” in college. This course sequence includes Geometry A, Algebra2/TrigA, Intro to Analysis and Calculus, and 
Advanced Placement AB Calculus. 
The most rigorous course of study is a four-year honors sequence that culminates with the Advanced Placement course 
BC Calculus. This course sequence includes Geometry H, Algebra2/TrigH, Analysis Honors, and Advanced Placement 
BC Calculus. 
It is possible for students to change between lanes over the course of their math education. Your student’s counselor, 
math  teacher,  and  the  Math  Instructional  Lead  (IL)  can  help  with  such  decisions.  Students  showing  academic 
responsibility, independence, and mastery on current year assessments might consider moving up a lane. Students not 
meeting these requirements are encouraged to speak with the IL for support choosing a new lane. Changing lanes may 
require summer work. 
Elective  courses  include  Advanced  Placement  Statistics  (full  year)  and  Applied  Math  H  (semester).  Other  elective 
courses which may receive math credit, such as Computer Science and BEAM, can be viewed in the CTE section of 
the course catalog.

>> SCIENCE 
To graduate from high school, students are required to have one year of physical science and one year of life science, 
both of which fulfill the University of California (UC) laboratory science requirement (known as UC ‘d’). Since the 
University  of  California  recommends  three  years  of  lab  science,  students  are  strongly  encouraged  to  take  yearlong 
courses  in  the  core  sciences – biology,  chemistry,  and  physics.  All  Gunn  science  course  offerings are  college-prep 
courses and fulfill the UC “d” requirement. 
While we encourage students to take on healthy challenges in their science course selection, strict policies regarding 
adding or dropping courses once the semester has begun are enforced. (See page 7 for lane change information.) For 
this  reason,  students  should  carefully  consider  their  course  choices.  To  assist  with  this  process,  in  each  course 
description,  the  Science  Department  has  listed  course  prerequisites,  predictors  of  success,  and  homework  time 
commitment expectations.

3609 
Grades 11-12 Year UC Approved “d” 
This course will prepare students to take the AP Chemistry examination. 
Life is Chemistry! In general chemistry, much of what we learn is foundational, but this will not be your typical lecture-
based chemistry course. The educational philosophy behind the course lies in hands on learning, and inquiry, which 
will challenge all types of learners. Therefore, students will be spending at least 40% of their time on laboratory work, 
some  of  which  may  need  to  be  completed  outside  of  class.  The  expectations  for  this  class are to  have  second-year 
chemistry  students  who  are  excited  about  learning  chemistry,  love  being  in  lab,  and  are  willing  to  work  through 
challenges. 
IMPORTANT  NOTE:  The  AP  Chemistry  course  is  taught  through  lab  performance  and  analysis.  Students  are 
required to utilize the knowledge taught in their first-year chemistry course, as that material will not be retaught. 
• Prerequisites: Successful completion of Chemistry OR Chemistry H and a very strong understanding of first-
year chemistry. Successful completion of a second-year algebra course (Alg 2 or higher). Students need a strong

3254 
Grades 10-12 Year UC Approved “d” 
 
Conceptual Physics is a college-prep course that is intended to meet the needs of those students who are still developing 
their basic algebraic skills in a first-year algebra course. The course also has a little out-of-class time commitment that 
could  give  students  who  do  not  have  intentions  of  studying  science  in  college  a  way  to  learn  physics  in  a  low-risk 
environment. It provides a rudimentary introduction to the fundamental principles of physics and how they apply to 
our  daily  lives.  Topics  covered  include  motion,  forces,  energy,  waves,  optics,  electricity,  and  magnetism.  Primary 
emphasis is placed on developing a conceptual understanding of topics, though simple mathematical formulas will be 
introduced and used to augment their understanding of how nature works. In such cases, use of these formulas will 
support the development of algebraic skills and provide reinforcement for material covered in introductory algebra 
courses.

PAINTING & DRAWING   ::   Pt/Dr 1
|
6340 
Grades 10-12 Year UC Approved “f” 
 
Drawing  is  the  foundation  of  all  artists  to describe  their  ideas,  regardless  of  the  medium  of  the  final  product.  This 
course will prepare any student to draw well by enhancing their ability to see subtle value ranges, create a full range of 
bold values, understand relationships of space and learn what makes a strong composition. This course can be repeated 
for two years with credit. 
Designed as the first course in the Drawing and Painting Program, the curriculum gradually builds upon itself to move 
from an exploration in expressive mark-making with graphite, conté, charcoal, colored pencil and pastel, to a painting 
experience.  Drawing  well  is  the  foundation  for  painting  well,  thus  it  is  after  drawing  that  advanced  color  theory, 
painting approaches and brush techniques are considered through acrylic, watercolor and digital painting. 
Assignments are designed to build the “artist’s tool belt”– the technical and expressive skills to render a broad range 
of surface qualities or textures upon the illusion of forms, in both black and white and color. The lessons encourage

Grades 10-12 Year UC Approved “f” 
This course can be used to fulfill a year of Career Tech Education (CTE) credit. 
Designed sequentially as the second course in the Drawing and Painting Program, Advanced Painting and Drawing is 
an expansion of the drawing and painting experience, and is less rigorous than the Honors curriculum. This course 
develops the artist’s expression to communicate visually and find personal meaning in student work. While building 
technical and expressive skills in advanced media such as Intaglio printmaking, oil painting, digital painting and mixed 
media, the creation of concept-driven work will be achievable. Through advanced understanding and use of design 
elements and principles, the beginning of a high- quality body of work will be developed in preparation for college 
and personal portfolios. 
Students will support one another’s artistic process through peer assessment, build articulation of conceptual meaning 
by  using  advanced  art  vocabulary  in  critiques,  and  create  a  positive  studio  environment.  This  course  is  for  mature 
artists who have a strong foundation in the use of multiple media, are serious about making art and have responsible 
studio behavior. 

Assignments  will  gradually  be  less  structured,  allowing  for  personal  motivation  towards  artistic  independence.

Spanish. At all levels of instruction students are immersed in the target language and culture. Emphasis is placed on 
oral  and  written  communication  using  performance-based  assessments.  Classes  are  offered  in  sequential  order  in 
order to build the proper foundation for oral and written proficiency. 
Students who successfully begin their language studies in middle school move directly into level 2. Students coming 
from out of the PAUSD district and/or who are native or heritage speakers or have been in after-school or immersion 
programs  are  required  to  take  a  placement  exam  to  determine  their  appropriate  placement.  Please  see  the  Gunn 
website or contact the World Language Instructional Leader or Department Secretary for more details about this exam.

of Foreign Language (ACTFL) proficiency guidelines: 
http://www.actfl.org/publications/guidelines-and-manuals/actfl-proficiency-guidelines-2012 
The  Gunn  World  Language  Department  supports  and  encourages  all  language  learning  to  the  highest  degree  of 
proficiency possible. To this end, we strongly encourage students to take language all four years of high school in order 
to  achieve  maximum  proficiency  in  reading,  writing,  speaking,  and  listening  according  to  the  ACTFL  Proficiency 
Guidelines with which all of our courses are aligned. If a student wishes to advance to a higher level, he or she must 
take  a  department-administered  proficiency  placement  test  before  the  beginning  of  the  school  year  in  order  to 
demonstrate the appropriate proficiency for the desired level.

AVID is a UC-approved elective class for students who are college-bound, but could use a bit more support. The AVID 
curriculum  focuses  on  writing,  inquiry,  collaboration,  organization,  and reading  (WICOR),  all  with  the  goal  of  getting 
students college ready. Tutorials, note-taking, study strategies, time management, standardized test prep, and goal setting 
are key components of the course. 
In ninth grade, a major focus is the transition to high school and keeping up with the workload. Tenth grade focuses on 
beginning  to  explore  potential  career  paths  and  expanding  future  college  resumes.  Eleventh  grade  starts  to  hone  in  on 
potential college fits and standardized test prep. By senior year, the focus shifts to the college application process and the 
transition out of high school. 
Interested students should sign up for the course, and they will be interviewed to see if they are a good fit for the program. 
Alternatively, current AVID students may be recommended by their AVID teacher.

SMALL LEARNING COMMUNITY 
Our  Small  Learning  Community  is designed  for  freshmen  and  will  provide  a  tightly  knit  community,  integrated 
curriculum, outdoor adventure, and opportunities to grow as leaders. 
All  students  will  share  some  common  classes  and  teachers.  The  content  and  standards  will  be  the  same  as  our 
traditional courses; however, in the Small Learning Community program, the teachers and students will work together 
to explore common themes and demonstrate their knowledge in some cross-curricular projects. 
Students in the Small Learning Community will be enrolled together in the same English, biology, and history courses 
which, in addition to the traditional content, will focus on leadership, character, and team building games. 
In addition, we will offer our students outdoor adventure trips and leadership training as they do a day field trip to 
YMCA  Ropes  Course,  Jasper  Ridge,  Angel  Island,  and  a  five-day  trip  to  Yosemite  and  take  part  in  the  Yosemite 
Institute. 

Our theme is “A Sense of Place,” and in our integrated curriculum, students will explore their place in history and in 
the local and global community. Our Small Learning Community will provide ninth graders with a sense of place at 
Gunn, as they transition from the middle to the high school.

SOCIAL JUSTICE PATHWAY COURSES 
What: 
The  Social  Justice  Pathway  is  a  three-year  program featuring  self-direction  and  project-based  learning  in  an 
interdisciplinary  model  rooted  in  community  action  and  collaboration.  Students  begin  by  learning  the  practices  of 
social justice in sophomore year by identifying global and local issues that they want to devote themselves to, and learn 
how to achieve transformative rather than temporary relief from social problems. This program encourages students 
of all backgrounds to appreciate the richness of their similarities and differences; to understand the beliefs, conditions 
and policies that have marginalized and oppressed populations; to listen with empathy; to foster in all their peers a 
sense of belonging to a community; and to resolve conflict peacefully; all in the name of Freedom, Justice and Equality. 
Who:
 This program is for students interested in empowerment, conviction and the passion to build a better world and 
are willing to work hard at it.
 
It is also a program that encourages diverse viewpoints. It provides an opportunity for 
authentic  education  and  experiential  learning  beyond  the  high  school  walls.  The  Social  Justice  Pathway  is  for  the 
student who is interested in rigorous curriculum that is not learned in a traditional way. 
How:
 Designed to be a school-within-a-school, this three-year program begins sophomore year. Gunn's social justice 
program  will  give  committed  students  the  opportunity  to  study  the  principles  of  justice,  freedom  and  equality  that 
form  our  nation's  core  values,  as  well  as  the  worldwide  history  of  oppression  and  injustice  towards  marginalized 
populations, within the context of the core college-preparatory and A-G approved curriculum. Students move together 
through Social Studies and AAR classes, working in a project-based environment both on and off campus. Class work 
is designed to connect to real issues identified by our students and challenges in our local community. Then, students 
make their own solutions to these problems and work to solve them. Social Justice Pathway is available for 10
th
, 11
th
 
and 12th grade students.

DUAL ENROLLMENT COURSES 
Dual Enrollment courses refer to high-school courses that have gone through curricular alignment with a community 
college  and  whose  students  are  enrolled  in  two  institutions  concurrently,  therefore  earning  high  school  credits  and 
college credits simultaneously. 
Students  in  dual  enrollment  courses  will  receive  regular  credit  per  course.  For  example,  if  a  “regular”  high school 
course earns five credits, the dual enrollment version of that course will earn five credits on the PAUSD transcript.  
Grades,  upon  completion  of  the  course,  will  be  weighted  similarly  to  AP  or  Honors  classes  in  weighted  GPA 
calculations, as they are rigorous courses that have gone through an alignment process with the community college. 
This also means that, if students decide to drop the class, they will need to consider the deadlines and consequences 
for doing so at each institution.

arguments, both written, multi-media, and oral. There is also a large collaborative component of the course, as students 
work in teams to present their findings. Similar to a "First-Year" seminar experience in college, students will engage in 
cross-curricular conversations that explore the complexities of academic and real-world topics and issues by analyzing 
divergent  perspectives  (scientific,  economic,  political,  cultural).  Students  should  be  strong  readers  of  non-fiction 
primary texts, fluent writers and team players.

APPENDIX   
TIME MANAGEMENT    
The number of hours you spend on certain tasks can be surprising, especially when you begin to compare the totals. 
Do you spend almost as much time doing extracurricular activities as you do academics? Do you sleep—at all? Are 
most of your meals eaten on the run? Do you wish you had more free time? As you begin to evaluate your current time 
expenditures, consider some of the points below. 
Academics 
When planning your academic time ask yourself... 
• How are you doing academically? Are you happy with your progress or do you feel you need to put more time 
into your work? Do you need more time for studying, assignments or both? 
• Which subjects are more challenging for you and require more of your time? Would it be helpful to seek help 
in the AC and/or Library? 
• Are you able to complete assignments on time? Do you have to stay up very late the night before an assignment 
is due to finish? 
• How often do you find yourself procrastinating on assignments? Do you need to work on using the academic 
time you have more effectively? 
• Do you currently use weekend time to study and do assignments? 
• Do you sometimes feel overwhelmed by the amount of work you have to do? 
• Do you usually study more than 2 days in advance of an exam? Are you able to prepare adequately for tests? 
Extracurricular Activities 
Finding the right balance between academics and extracurricular activities can be difficult. A commitment made to an 
activity at the start of the year might not be easy to continue if classes become consuming. 
When planning your extracurricular time ask yourself... 
• Which of your extracurricular activities is most important to you? Why? 
• Which of these activities help you to relax? Which help you to relieve or work off stress? 
• Does your enthusiasm sometimes lead you to overcommitting to activities, clubs, sports, etc.? 
• Have your extracurricular commitments ever adversely affected your academics? Are they adversely affecting 
your academics now? 
• Which do you enjoy more: well-structured activities with meeting times and established goals or independent 
activities that you pursue at your own pace? 
• Which  of  your  extracurricular  activities  could  you  pursue  in  other  ways?  Are  there  more  flexible  ways  to 
participate in the same activity? 
Sleep 
Students love to sleep; yet it is the first thing they give up when pressed for time. Not only is sleep necessary for your 
physical and mental well-being, you will simply not be able to concentrate well if you are tired, distracted and mentally 
run  down.  You  will  spend  more  time  on  assignments,  learn  appreciably  less  and  be  vulnerable  to  making  obvious 
mistakes on exams and projects. Although it might feel as though you are doing more by sleeping less, the habit isn’t 
sustainable, so sleep well and often, and consider it an investment. 
  

When planning for sleep time ask yourself... 
• How many hours of sleep per night are ideal for you? How many hours of sleep do you need to wake up feeling 
rested and refreshed, but not groggy? 
• Between which hours of the day are you most comfortable sleeping? 
• Do you feel that you get enough sleep now? 
• When you run short of time on assignments, do you sacrifice sleep to make up the balance? 
• Do you often feel tired or lethargic in class, especially in the morning? 
• Do you sometimes have difficulty concentrating in class and/or have headaches due to fatigue? 
• Do you occasionally fall asleep in class? 
• Do you often wish for (or take) a nap during the day? 
• Are you able to get out of bed when the alarm clock rings the first time? 
Meals 
Eating is just as important as sleeping for all the same reasons. Always eat something in the morning, even if it is just 
a breakfast bar on the way to class. Plan to make sit-down time for lunch and dinner—not only because you need the 
fuel, but because you need physical, mental and emotional breaks in your day. Meals can rejuvenate you on all of these 
levels.  Relax, eat well and enjoy yourself. 
When planning for meal time ask yourself... 
• Do you make a point of eating regularly and well? Although you can’t always have a healthy, well-balanced 
meal, do you usually try to make health-conscious decisions? 
• Do you occasionally skip meals? How do you feel when you do? 
• Does being hungry sometimes distract you in class? 
Free Time! 
At last! Are you surprised at the amount of free time that you have? Is it too much or too little? Do you prefer your 
days to be more flexible and spontaneous or packed and busy? The amount of free time that you have at the start of 
the  year  might  diminish  as  you  find  fun things  to  do  and  your  academics  gain  momentum.  Again, a  conservative 
approach  is  often  best: leave  yourself  some  space  to  unwind  and  relax  every  day,  and  extra  time  to  handle  the 
unexpected – whether it is a difficult assignment or going out with friends. 
When planning for free time ask yourself... 
• Which  of  your  free  time  activities  are  most  important  to  you?  Which  could  you  give  up  if  you  wanted  or 
needed to spend time on other things? 
• Which of these activities help you to relax? Which help you to relieve or work off stress? 
• Do you occasionally find yourself procrastinating by overindulging in one of these activities? Do you need to 
be more disciplined about limiting these activities? 
• Is there something that you would really like to do or try, but you never seem to have the time? Could you fit 
it in by reprioritizing your other tasks?
