As a club, our plan is to host webinars with local officials, write petitions and policy proposals for the School Board, and work with the statewide organization to sponsor educational advocacy campaigns. Some examples of our past activities include hosting a webinar with Author Julie Lythcott-Haims, making calls to get AB331 (the Ethnic Studies graduation requirement) passed through the Assembly, and working with Vote16PA on creating a candidate questionnaire for the 2020 local elections.",
