                WATT was jointly created by <a href="https://github.com/ky28059">Kevin</a>, who made the frontend,{' '}
                and <a href="https://github.com/ytchang05">Yu-Ting</a>, who made the backend.{' '}
                This app would not have been possible without its predecessor, <a href="https://github.com/Orbiit/gunn-web-app">UGWA</a>.{' '}
                A large thank you to <a href="https://github.com/SheepTester">Sean</a>, for not just UGWA but also for the Schoology integration WATT relies on.
