Whether it be a debate about white vs. wheat bread or how French & Japanese bread are different, you are guaranteed to leave with a better understanding of a prominent pillar of the world's diet! Afterward, members can participate in an activity based on what we learned, like a trivia game. Lastly, all members who completed our attendance form are entered into our daily raffle for the chance to win a prize. On special days, we may offer bread for the whole club!    Disclaimer: Unfortunately, the Bread Appreciation Club does not have the time, resources, or equipment to bake bread.    We'd loaf to see you at the club, so come by to enjoy the beauties of bread with fellow enthusiasts 🍞.",
